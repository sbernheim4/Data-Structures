# Data-Structures

This contains several different popular data structures which I have implemented myself. All the individual files work without the need for additional structures. If there is a folder it is because the data structure in that folder needs additional files which will also be found in that folder. I may also include my own solutions to classic problems or problems which I have solved myself.

I coded all this using the IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm IDE but only the appropriate .java or .py files will be uploaded.
